mat_graph
=========
This is a matlab project for our matlab sessional.. 
The aim of this project is to plot any mathematical equation. The equation may be 2D or 3D. Besides, users could get relevant information about the equation both graphically and analytically. This information include-
• Differentiation
• Integration
• Arc-length
• Evaluation
• Roots !
There will be options for both 2D and 3D graph. Scaling may be linear or logarithmic. The co-ordinate systems that can be used are -
• Cartesian
• Polar
• Cylindrical
• Spherical
!
Besides plotting graph, this project will cover a few important tasks. Such as-
• Solution of homogenous systems of equation
• Solution of non-homogenous systems of equation
• interpolation of some given values, that will include linear interpolation, quadratic interpolation, cubic
interpolation, exponential interpolation etc.
• Fourier analysis
